# jsTodo
A to-do app created using Vanilla JS. This app performs all variety of steps that are commonly performed in a todo application.
1. Adding an item.
2. Removing an item once it is marked.
3. Validation: if the user didn't enter a text in the input, and when pressed "Add" it will show an error.
4. User cannot delete an item until the user marked the item as done.

Also I have carried out browser compatibility testing. I made sure the code written works in every modern browsers. The code I have written is clean and understandable.
